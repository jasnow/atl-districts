# Find My City Council Member #
## About ##
At the [2013 Atlanta Govathon Hackathon](http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2013/11/18/govathon-ii-civic-hackers-come-back-to-city-hall-for-more-techno-troubleshooting)
[Jordan Streiff](https://github.com/supertrill) and [Gerry Pass](https://github.com/rgpass) started the Find My City 
Council Member app from scratch. This simple app went on to win the "Atlanta Just Go Ahead and Implement This" award.

Check out the [live demo](http://www.jordanstreiff.com/atlanta-districts/).
